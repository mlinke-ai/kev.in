## Development Guidelines

#### Folder Structure

##### `src/lib/components`

Here is where to move new svelte components. If you have multiple components that depend on each other, consider creating a new folder for them inside this directory.

> Components should start with a capital letter in CamelCase style



##### `src/lib/functions`

If you have any piece of code that looks to big for a component or is used by many components, create a JavaScript file here.



##### `src/routes`

To create new pages for the website, use the `Example.svelte` file as a template.

To add your pages to the routing system, you have to add it to `index.js` inside of the routes directory.

If you need to add pages to the navigation bar, add them to `src/lib/components/Navbar/config.js`

> Every page has to be inside a  `<Page />` component. It provides smooth transitions when switching pages, enables you to set a title in the browser and protect pages from unauthorized access.
